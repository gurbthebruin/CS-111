lab4b.c: Source code for an embedded application that builds and runs (with no errors or warnings) on an embedded system

Makefile: to build and test your application. The higher level targets should include:
	default ... build your program (compiling with the -Wall and -Wextra options).
	check ... execute an automated smoke-test of your application to see if it runs and can talk to its sensors.
	clean ... delete all programs and output generated by the Makefile
	dist ... (runnable on a Linux desktop or server) create the deliverable tarball
	Note that this Makefile is intended to be executed on an embedded system

smoketest.sh: test cases for make check

README file containing:
	descriptions of each of the included files
	any other comments on your submission that you would like to bring to our attention (e.g., research, limitations, features, testing methodology).
