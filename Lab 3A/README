lab3a.c: source code for program to analyze the file system in that image file and output a summary to standard out (describing the super block, groups, free-lists, inodes, indirect blocks, and directories).

A Makefile to build and run the deliverable program. The higher level targets should be:
default ... compile your program (with the -Wall and -Wextra options) to produce an executable named lab3a
dist ... create the deliverable tarball
clean ... delete all programs and output generated by the Makefile.

a README text file containing descriptions of each of the included files and any other information about your submission that you would like to bring to our attention (e.g., research, limitations, features, testing methodology).
