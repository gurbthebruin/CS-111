Makefile: Supports the default, build, and clean targets, which: 

default: build your program to produce an executable named lab3b
dist: create the deliverable tarball
clean: delete all programs and output generated by the Makefile, and return the directory to its freshly un-tar-ed state.

Also, created a default rule that creates a lab3b link as per spec
